## About This Project    <img src="https://github.com/Anmol-Baranwal/Cool-GIFs-For-GitHub/assets/74038190/a2605358-6b87-44ab-87fb-20dcdc5f9ef2" width="55">&nbsp;
Hey everyone! Welcome to a guide on turning a Raspberry Pi into a super cool retro gaming console using the WaveShare Gameboy HAT. I had a blast making this, and it was so easy that I ended up helping three of my friends make their own too!    <img src="https://cultofthepartyparrot.com/parrots/hd/60fpsparrot.gif" width="25" height="25"/>

So, this whole thing started as a fun experiment with Raspberry Pi's, and it turned out to be a total win. I figured out a bunch of neat tricks along the way and Iâ€™ve put them all in this guide. If youâ€™re looking to have some fun and get into gaming with the Pi, youâ€™re in the right place.

Hereâ€™s what it looked like when I was putting it together:

*Ready to play and enjoy!*

The best part? It was super straightforward. Iâ€™ll walk you through what I did, step by step, from snapping the parts together to firing it up with Recalbox. Itâ€™s really that easy, and trust me, itâ€™s a lot of fun.

### Whatâ€™s Cool About This Guide?

- **Keep It Simple**: Iâ€™ve made the instructions clear and easy to follow. Youâ€™ll be up and running in no time.
- **Extra Tips**: Iâ€™ll share some custom tweaks that can help you get more out of your console.

# Assembling the WaveShare Game HAT and Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This is a quick guide to assembling the WaveShare Game HAT with your Raspberry Pi.

**Snap the Game HAT onto the Raspberry Pi**:
   - Gently press the Game HAT down so that the GPIO pins slide into the Game HAT's connector.
   

## Features as included on the Waveshare Wiki

- **3.5inch IPS Screen**: 480 Ã— 320 resolution ensures clear and vibrant visuals.
- **60 FPS Gameplay**: Experience smooth and responsive gameplay with no frame loss.
- **Compatibility**: Supports Raspberry Pi A+/B+/2B/3B/3B+/4B models. Raspberry Pi Zero variants require an additional HDMI cable.
- **Portable Gaming**: Powered by an 18650 lithium battery (not included), allowing for gaming anywhere, anytime.
- **Built-in Audio**: Includes onboard speaker and earphone jack.

## Installation Guide For RecalBox OS

### Setting Up Recalbox:

1. **Download the Recalbox Image**:
   - Obtain the latest Recalbox image for your Raspberry Pi model from [Recalbox Official Download](https://download.recalbox.com/en/#step3allimages).

2. **Write the Image to an SD Card**:
   - Use Balena Etcher or the Raspberry Pi imaging app or a similar tool to write the Recalbox image to your SD card.

3. **Modify the `config.txt` File**:
   - Add the following configurations to enhance compatibility with the Game HAT:
     ```
     hdmi_force_hotplug=1
     hdmi_group=2
     hdmi_mode=4
     hdmi_drive=2
     display_rotate=0
     avoid_warnings=1
     ```

4. **Install the SD Card and Start Your Raspberry Pi**:
   - Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi.
   - Connect the Raspberry Pi to the Game HAT and then connect the HDMI adapter.
   - Power on the device using the switch on the Game HAT.

### Configuring GPIO Pins and Recalbox:

1. **Access the System via SSH**:
   - Ensure your Raspberry Pi is connected to the Internet.
   - Use SSH to log into your system with the default credentials:
     - **Username**: root
     - **Password**: recalboxroot
   - Retrieve your IP address using `ifconfig`.

2. **Modify the Recalbox Configuration**:
   - Execute the following commands to enable write access:
     ```
     mount -o remount,rw /
     mount -o remount,rw /boot
     ```
   - Edit the `recalbox.conf` file using nano:
     ```
     nano /recalbox/share/system/recalbox.conf
     ```
   - Update the GPIO controller settings:
     ```
     controllers.gpio.enabled=1
     controllers.gpio.args=map=5 gpio=5,6,13,19,21,4,26,12,23,20,16,18,-1
     ```

3. **Save and Reboot**:
   - Save your changes in nano and reboot your Raspberry Pi to apply the new settings.
     
4. **How to add ROMS using SSH**:
   - SSH Setup on Windows and Mac
   - Accessing your Raspberry Pi via SSH allows you to control and configure your system remotely. Here's how to set it up on both Windows and macOS.
   - Windows SSH Setup
     
## Windows SSH Setup

1. **Install PuTTY**:
   - Download and install [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).

2. **Obtain Raspberry Pi IP Address**:
   - Connect your Raspberry Pi to a monitor and keyboard, then use `ifconfig` to find the IP.

3. **Connect Using PuTTY**:
   - Open PuTTY, enter your Raspberry Pi's IP address, and select "SSH" as the connection type.
   - Default username: `root`, password: `recalboxroot`.

4. **Access the Recalbox Configuration**:
   - Run the following commands to enable write access and edit the configuration:
```bash
mount -o remount,rw /
nano /recalbox/share/system/recalbox.conf
```
5. **Tip**:
   - If you go to the file explorer and click in the serach you can //192.168.100 (example) and it will take you directly to the RecalBox config files and you can easily access the ROMS folder there.
   - Drag and drop your ROMS and you should be set!
     
## macOS SSH Setup

1. **Use Terminal**:

   Open Terminal and connect to your Raspberry Pi using the following command:

```bash
ssh root@<Your_Raspberry_Pi_IP>
Example:
```

```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.100
Default password: recalboxroot.
```


```bash
reboot
```
